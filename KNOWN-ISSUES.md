## Known Issues

ðŸ›‘ Unfortunately, we must inform you that our project is no longer maintained and there is no current plan to address these issues.   
### Unhandled division by zero
Synchronization throws the following error in logs:  
indexer.block.fetcher.import throws ArithmeticError bad argument during synchronization.  
   
An upstream fix was developed in Pull Request #6599, but merging was causing deploying issues, so the fix wasn't applied.
